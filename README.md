# ImageCleaner
Tiny program that detects and eventually deletes corrupted and/or duplicate image files from one folder.

NOTE: If you use this in a folder with files that are not images, this program will detect them as corrupted and banish them from existence, so please don't. And if you do, you were warned here and I take no responsibility.
